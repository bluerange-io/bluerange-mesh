= Features
This is a non exhaustive list of features of FruityMesh.

* Automatic meshing and self-healing capabilities with
<<The-FruityMesh-Algorithm.adoc#,The FruityMesh Algorithm>>
* UART Terminal to execute commands with a list of arguments for either
manual or automated communication with a MeshGateway (see
<<Usage.adoc#,Usage>>)
* Debug Logger with support for filtering log tags (see
<<Usage.adoc#,Usage>>)
* Modular structure with persistent module configurations (see
<<Modules.adoc#,Modules>>)
* Encrypted mesh and Smartphone connections
* <<AdvertisingModule.adoc#,AdvertisingModule>> for configuring custom
broadcast messages such as EddyStone or iBeacon
* <<StatusReporterModule.adoc#,StatusReporterModule>> for monitoring
the nodes
* <<EnrollmentModule.adoc#,EnrollmentModule>> for provisioning nodes
(locally or over an existing mesh) and giving them access to a mesh
* <<IoModule.adoc#,IoModule>> for signaling commands using leds or
other pins
* <<MeshAccessModule.adoc#,MeshAccessModule>> for handling connections
from/to Smartphones and other devices
* Time Synchronisation over the mesh (see <<Usage.adoc#,Usage>>)
* <<RecordStorage.adoc#,RecordStorage>> A record based filesystem for
storing data in flash
* Automatic packet splitting if packets are bigger than the connection
MTU.
* Automatic cycling of different advertising messages with the
AdvertisingController.
* Watchdog in case of node failure
* Low <<Battery-Consumption.adoc#,Battery Consumption>>

== Closed Source features
A number of modules of FruityMesh are not yet
open source but can be used by our customers. Contact us if you are
interested.

* <<DfuModule.adoc#,DfuModule>> firmware updates over the mesh, not
limited to FruityMesh but also available for connected controllers.
* <<AssetModule.adoc#,AssetModule>> broadcasting of asset telemetry
messages that can be located indoors by our infrastructure.
* We have already implemented a number of Custom modules and
customization of FruityMesh for many of our customers.

== Feature Roadmap

* Coming soon to GitHub: Our CherrySim - written in C++ - simulates the
mesh using the FruityMesh code and allows us to implement unit and
system tests. image:img/cherrysim.png[cherrysim]
