= Node

ModuleId 0

== Purpose

The node module is the central part of the FruityMesh Algorithm. It is a
mandatory module. It is responsible for clustering and other mesh
related tasks and functionalities that are part of FruityMesh.

== Functionality

The node keeps track of all MeshConnections and monitors connects and
disconnects. It works in conjunction with the MeshConnection and
ConnectionManager classes for this. The node is also responsible for
broadcasting mesh discovery (<<Specification.adoc#,JOIN_ME>>) packets. It will also activate
scanning if necessary and monitor the incoming discovery packets of
other nodes. It will create new MeshConnections to other nodes if
necessary. A state machine is used to toggle between different discovery
states.

____
There are a number of undocumented commands. These are mostly for
debugging and there is no guarantee that they will be available in
future builds.
____

== Terminal Commands

=== Setting the Discovery State

`action [nodeId] node discovery [on / off]`

It might be necessary to switch the node's state machine into a
different discovery state. This can be done through the mesh and can be
used by a MeshGateway to turn off discovery once all enrolled nodes are
connected. This allows the node to use a very low power consumption if
scanning does not have to be active for other tasks.

Once the node loses a connection to one of its partners, it will
automatically switch discovery on again.

Examples

[source,C++]
----
//E.g. switch discovery off for all nodes
action 0 node discovery off
----

The response acknowledges the receipt of the command.

[source,Javascript]
----
{"type":"set_discovery_result","nodeId":123,"module":0}
----

=== Getting basic information (Local Command)

`status`

It is very conveniant to get easily readable information about a node.
The status command displays the currently active connections and their
state. It also display device information and the clustering state.

The following will be printed on the local terminal after the command
was entered:

....
Node BBBBB (nodeId: 1) vers: 80000, NodeKey: 01:00:....:00:00

Mesh clusterSize:10, clusterId:4201185286
Enrolled 1: networkId:10, deviceType:0, NetKey 04:00:....:00:00, UserBaseKey 00:00:....:00:00
Addr:00:00:00:01:00:00, ConnLossCounter:3, AckField:0, State: 1

CONNECTIONS 2 (freeIn:0, freeOut:2, pendingPackets:0
IN (0) FM 7, state:4, cluster:fa690006(8), sink:-1, Queue:0-0(0), Buf:1/7, mb:0, hnd:16
OUT(1) FM 10, state:4, cluster:fa690006(1), sink:-1, Queue:0-0(0), Buf:1/7, mb:1, hnd:17
....

=== Setting the Terminal Mode (Local Command)

When working with UART (Terminal and Uart must be enabled), FruityMesh
supports a convenient blocking terminal mode with echo back
functionality. For communication with another device such as a
MeshGateway, an interrupt based input method and json output is used. To
toggle between these two modes, there are two commands.

`startterm`

Using startterm will use a blocking mode where all functionality is
halted and user input is received in a busy loop until a line feed '\r'
is received. The command will then be processed and other functionality
will be resumed. The input will be echoed back on the terminal and
backspace is supported as well for most terminal programs. If the
command cannot be recognized, a warning will be echoed.

`stopterm`

The stopterm command will switch the node into an interrupt based input
mode where terminal input does not affect the functionality until a line
feed '\r' is received. All output messages will be in json format.

== Rebooting (Local Command)

`reset`

If you just want to reset the node via the terminal, enter this command
and it will do a software reboot.

== Time Synchronization

If you want to synchronize a time over the mesh, you must first set the
time to your local node using the settime command. It is internally
stored as an unsigned 32 bit integer.

`settime [unixTimestampSec]`

Afterwards, you can query the time of the local node using:

`gettime`

The output should give you the current time and date of the node in a
human readable form. Be aware that this is only an approximate
calculation. It is just for debugging if the time was set correctly.
Internally, the nodes only work with unix timestamps. Afterwards, you
can use the sendtime command to synchronize the time to all other mesh
nodes. Currently, this is a trivial implementation, but will improve in
the future to automatically synchronize the time every few hours and
also synchronize it to nodes that are new to the mesh network.

`sendtime`

== Querying Active Modules

`get_modules [nodeId]`

Often, it is necessary to get a list of modules that are available on a
node. The returned list includes all modules that are available
(compiled into the firmware): their moduleId, their version and whether
they are currently active.

[source,Javascript]
----
{
    "nodeId": 1,
    "type": "module_list",
    "modules": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "version": 2,
            "active": 1
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "version": 1,
            "active": 0
        },
        // ...
    ]

== Sending raw data

=== General overview

image::img/raw_data_flow.png[]

Sending raw data can be used to send any arbitrary data, for example (but not limited to) zip files. The data which should be sent is split into various chunks which are then sent through the mesh. The data which should be sent is called the "payload".

Every raw data transaction (except raw_data_light, which will be explained later) starts with a raw_data_start message. This message includes the amount of chunks in the transaction and the protocol of the payload. Once the receiver receives this message, he answers with a raw_data_start_received message, which indicates to the sender that the receiver is ready for the transaction of the chunks.

When the sender receives this message, he starts sending all the raw_data_chunks. Besides part of the payload, every raw_data_chunk includes a chunkID which is a uniquely (regarding the current transaction) ascending number, starting at 1 for the raw_data_chunks. The chunkID 0 is reserved for the raw_data_start which always implicitly has the chunkID 0. Using this chunkID, and the information of the amount of chunks form the raw_data_start message, the receiver is able to determine whether or not a received chunk is the last chunk in the transaction. Once he receives the last chunk he reports back to the sender using a single raw_data_report. This message includes up to three missing chunkIDs. If all chunks were received, the list of missing chunks is empty, which tells the sender that the transaction was successful. If however, the list of missing chunks is not empty, the sender must send the chunks with the corresponding chunkIDs again. The last chunkID of the previous raw_data_report message acts as a last chunk, regarding the sending of additional raw_data_reports. This sending of raw_data_chunks and raw_data_reports is repeated until raw_data_report has an empty list of missing chunkIDs.

All devices involved in the communication (meaning both sender and receiver as well as the mesh) are able to cancel the communication by sending a raw_data_error message to the sender as well as the receiver. If the sender or the receiver is the device that hung up the transmission, it is allowed to not send the error to itself. The raw_data_error message includes an error code, indicating the reason for the cancellation. It is possible to receive a raw_data_error message without an open transmission. This can happen for example, if the sender cancels the transmission using a raw_data_error, but this error is dropped during the transmission. The receiver then might send another raw_data_error indicating a timeout while the sender already canceled the communication. Such messages without an open transmission may be discarded.

=== Dropped messages

As any other message in the mesh, every message in the raw send protocol could be dropped. This section describes how an implementation must behave in such scenarios. It also tells the obligations of the sender and the receiver.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Dropped message | Reaction
|raw_data_start or raw_data_start_received | The sender must send the raw_data_start again after a timeout of 10 seconds or stop the transmission. The receiver thus has to be able to handle several successive raw_data_start messages with the same content (in case the raw_data_start_received message is dropped) as well as closing a dropped connection after a timeout of 15 seconds (in case the sender does not send another raw_data_start).
|raw_data_chunk | Missing chunks are reported in raw_data_report once the last chunk is received. These missing chunks must be resent.
|Last raw_data_chunk or raw_data_report | Using the ChunkID, both sender and receiver are able to identify the last data chunk. If this message or the raw_data_report is dropped, the sender must send the last chunk again. This however means that the receiver is only allowed to save the last chunk id once the first chunk after a raw_data_report is received, not immediately after the raw_data_report is sent.
|raw_data_error | If a raw_data_error message is dropped, the sender or receiver has already canceled the transmission, leading to the sending of another raw_data_error upon receiving an invalid out-of-transmission message or a raw_data_error indicating a timeout. In the rare cases where the origin of the raw_data_error is the mesh itself, it could happen that both raw_data_errors are dropped. In such cases the connection is still up but probably will create another raw_data_error once the ill-formed chunk is sent again.

=== Start of a transmission
`raw_data_start [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [numChunks] [protocolId] {requestHandle = 0}`

This command starts a raw data transmission. The payload shall be sent using raw_data_chunk messages.

[cols=",,", options="header",]
|===
|Parameter | Type | Description
|receiverId | u16 | The NodeID that this message should be sent to
|destinationModuleId | u8 | The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0.
|numChunks | u24 | Number of Chunks for the total message. Must not be 0.
|protocolId | u8 | One of the protocolIds mentioned in the table below
|requestHandle | u8 | A handle that can be used to distinguish between different raw data transmissions (Default: 0)

|2 | GZIPPED_JSON | A JSON that was gzipped
|3 - 199 | Reserved | Not yet used
|200 - 255 | User defined | May be different in each implementation
|===

If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this:
[source,javascript]
----
{
	"nodeId":5,
	"type":"raw_data_start",
	"module":4,

}
----

=== Accepting a transmission
`raw_data_start_received [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] {requestHandle = 0}`

Once a raw_data_start is received, the receiver shall send the sender a raw_data_start_received message.

[cols=",,", options="header",]
|===
|Parameter | Type | Description
|receiverId | u16 | The NodeID that this message should be sent to
|destinationModuleId | u8 | The ModuleId is used for giving context to this message. If the transmission should only be printed on the receiver and otherwise be ignored by the firmware, it must be set to 0.

If received by a JSON capable device, the raw_data_start will be printed out like this:
[source,javascript]
----
{

=== Subsequent chunk messages
`raw_data_chunk [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [chunkId] [payloadHex] {requestHandle = 0}`

Once a raw transmission was started, the appropriate number of chunks should follow in the correct order. Once the  last chunk is received by the receiver it is possible to reassemble and parse the whole message. The moduleId is present in all chunks so that they can be assigned to the correct stream and to avoid clashes between different modules. A module can send intermittent data streams if is uses different request handles.

----

=== Sending a report
`raw_data_report [receiverId] [destinationModuleId] [MissingChunkIds] {requestHandle = 0}`

Once the last chunk is received, the receiver sends this message to the sender, indicating either a successful transmission (empty missing chunk IDs) or informs the sender about missing chunk IDs.
