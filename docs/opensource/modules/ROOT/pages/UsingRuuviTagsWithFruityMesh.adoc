= Using RuuviTags with FruityMesh

FruityMesh can not only be used with the nRF52-DK or the nRF52840-DK from Nordic, but with many other boards with nRF52 Series SoCs.

This article will teach you how to use the versatile https://ruuvi.com/ruuvitag-specs/[RuuviTags] from https://ruuvi.com[Ruuvi Innovations Oy] together with FruityMesh.
We will flash the `prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52` featureset which uses the `RuuviWeatherModule` that reads sensor data and sends it through the mesh to be advertised in a format compatible with the Ruuvi Station app from all connected nodes.

This will give you multiple sensor nodes utilizing FruityMesh for establishing the self-finding, -maintaining, and -healing, bidirectional mesh based on scatter net logic.
The mesh network is used to transport the sensor data from each node to every other node, which makes it possible to see sensor data from all mesh nodes regardless of the nodes you're physically close to.

== Requirements

To follow this tutorial we recommend that you have

* at least two RuuviTags,
* and either
** the https://shop.ruuvi.com/product/devkit/[Devkit] from Ruuvi which contains
*** a Nordic nRF52-DK
*** and a shield for the DK that connects to the RuuviTag using pogopins
** or alternatively
*** a Segger J-Link programmer
    footnote:[Check if you're elegible for a https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu/[J-Link EDU].]
*** and a programming cable compatible with your RuuviTag.
    footnote:[Check the https://lab.ruuvi.com/pinout/[pinout] of your RuuviTag.]
    footnote:[Standard 10-pin ARM Cortex debug connector for the RuuviTag Rev.B5 and below.
              The cable might be included with your programmer already.
              You _have to solder the male pin-header_ onto the RuuviTag yourself.] 
    footnote:[http://www.tag-connect.com/TC2030-CTX-NL[TC2030 Tag-Connect] for the RuuviTag Rev.B6 and above.
              This does not require any soldering but you will have to buy the cable.]

This tutorial assumes you own the Ruuvi Devkit.

If you own a Segger programmer and are able to connect it to the RuuviTag correctly, the outputs from the commands will be the same as with the Devkit.

WARNING: The (precompiled) firmware will -- without modifications -- only work on RuuviTags. It is however very easy to change the supported device to the nRF52-DK, just open `config/featuresets/prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52.cpp` and follow the instructions.

== Precompiled Firmware

For a quick start you can flash the precompiled firmware `prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52_merged.hex` from the `fruitymesh-..._precompiled.zip` following xref:Quick-Start.adoc#Precompiled[Quick Start / Flashing Precompiled Firmware].

== Building and Flashing

Please follow xref:Quick-Start.adoc#_installing_the_toolchain[Quick Start / Compile FruityMesh / Installing the Toolchain] to setup your development environment.
The commands in the following text were executed on a machine running Linux, you will have to adapt the paths according to your own setup.

We will begin with a shell in your clone of the https://github.com/mwaylabs/fruitymesh[FruityMesh repository].

```
┏━ 2021-02-24 16:46:13 user@host:~/doc/code/fruitymesh

We will first create the _out-of-source_ build directory.

```
┏━ 2021-02-24 16:46:14 user@host:~/doc/code/fruitymesh
$ mkdir ../fruitymesh_build
┗━ ✓
```

Then we configure the build directory for building the firmware and specify the path to the ARM GCC 4.9 (downloading and extracting this was part of the xref:Quick-Start.adoc#_installing_the_toolchain[Quick Start] guide).

```

Now we will build the `prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52` featureset which will compile the firmware `prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52.out`, transform it in to an Intel `.hex` file `prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52.hex` and finally merge it with the SoftDevice (Nordics protocol stack) `s132_nrf52_5.1.0_softdevice.hex`.

The previous step generated the merged firmware file `prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52_merged.hex` ready for flashing onto your RuuviTag.
Our CMake build system generates `...\_flash` targets for every featureset, which call upon `nrfjprog` from the _nRF Command-Line Tools_ to flash the firmware on a connected device.

WARNING: Please _remove_ the battery from the RuuviTag before pressing it on the Ruuvi Devkit.

If you use a devkit from Ruuvi (with the shield plugged in to the Nordic nRF52-DK) and have *no* RuuviTag pressed on the pogopins you *will* see the following error when you build the `..._flash` target.
This happens because the shield forces the Segger chip (the big quad flat package next to the Micro-USB port) on the nRF52-DK to always connect via the debug header (the row of male pins above the Segger chip) to an external chip and not directly to the nRF52832 on the nRF52-DK.

```

To programm the RuuviTag, just press it on the pogopins such that the three alignment pins slide into the holes of the RuuviTag.
Then hold it on the shield and execute the flash command (a bit of an excercise for your hand and the reason Ruuvi provided you with cable ties).

Now you just push the RuuviTags on CR2477 batteries and they will startup and connect to each other automatically.

When you push your RuuviTags on CR2477 batteries you will be able to add the tags to your Ruuvi Station app on your Smartphone.

If you want to run the firmware on other boards, you *will* need to modify `config/featuresets/prod_ruuvi_weather_nrf52.cpp`.
