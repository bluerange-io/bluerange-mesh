== Closed Source Features
A number of modules of FruityMesh are not yet
open source but can be used by customers. Contact us if you are
interested.

* xref:DfuModule.adoc[DfuModule] firmware updates over the mesh, not
limited to FruityMesh, but also available for connected controllers
* xref:bluerange-firmware:ROOT:AssetModule.adoc[AssetModule]: Broadcasting of asset telemetry
messages that can be located indoors by our infrastructure
* A number of xref:Tutorials.adoc[custom modules] and customization of FruityMesh have
already been implemented for many customers.

== Feature Roadmap

Coming soon to GitHub:

CherrySim, written in C++, simulates the mesh using the FruityMesh code and allows to implement unit and system tests.

== Feature Details

=== Sink Determination
During clustering, a new node performs a handshake with its partner node and exchanges information about the network structure. This includes the cluster size and also the master bit that is used to determine which cluster must dissolve if a connection is lost. This handshake also includes the number of hops to the sink (MeshGateway). This information is also included in the clusterInfoUpdate packets that notify all nodes about changes in the network.

If a sink is available through a connection, the number of hops to this sink will be sent with these packets. The sink itself has 0 hops to the sink. If there is no sink available, it is denoted with -1.

=== Watchdog With Safe Boot Mode
The hardware watchdog is configured to restart a node after a certain time if it doesn't receive a keep alive packet from the gateway in the meantime. This is the last fallback to recover a node if there is some critical unknown issue. This issue will then be reported as a watchdog reboot using the error log of a node.

It is possible to configure the watchdog to use safe boot. In safe boot mode, the node will boot up without loading any persistant configuration. This also means that the node will not be enrolled in this mode, but it will reboot in normal mode after the watchdog triggers again. This makes it possible to rescue a node that received a faulty persistent configuration.

== Error Log & Live Error Reporting
Each node can store a number of errors in RAM. The timestamp, error code and some extra information can be stored. This log can be queried every few minutes or hours. The errors have different significance and some information is logged using a counter that always increments. This statistical information can be used to determine the health of a live mesh and to monitor it. Storing the errors is necessary as they might be generated while a node is disconnected from the mesh. The error log will be cleared once the errors have been queried.

Additionally, live error logging can be used to send information about errors through the mesh instantly. This will only work if the node is part of the mesh.
