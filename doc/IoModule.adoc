= IO Module (moduleId 6)

== Purpose 

Driving and configuring all GPIOs. E.g. toggling an LED, a motor or reading values from a basic sensor.

== Functionality 
The IO module does only support toggling of LEDs and
different pins at the moment. It will be extended to include support for
basic sensors that can be read by e.g. analog/digital conversion.

=== Change led mode 
Changes the led mode to either on, off (depending on
configuration either off permanently or connection signaling)

[source,C++]
----
//Set led mode
action [nodeId] io led [mode = on / off / cluster]

//Switch leds on on all nodes
action 0 io led on
----

=== Set Pins
Sets a pin to either high or low output.

[source,C++]
----
//Configure pins low or high
action [nodeId] io pinset [pinNumber] [mode] ...

//Configure Pins 21 and 22
action 0 io pinset 21 high 22 low
----
