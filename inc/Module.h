 * The Module class can be subclassed for a number of purposes:
 * - Implement a driver for a sensor or an actuator
 * - Add functionality like parsing advertising data, etc...
 *
 * It provides a basic set of handlers that are called from the main event handling
 * routines and the received events can be used and acted upon.
